   <text:p text:style-name="P12"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P22"><text:span text:style-name="T5">The years following Bahá’u’lláh’s arrival in Adrianople witnessed His Revelation’s attainment, in the words of Shoghi Effendi, of “its meridian glory” through the proclamation of its Founder’s message to the kings and rulers of the world. <text:s/>During this relatively brief but turbulent period of the Faith’s history, and in the early years of His subsequent exile in 1868 to the fortress town of ‘Akká, He summoned the monarchs of East and West collectively, and some among them individually, to recognize the Day of God and to acknowledge the One promised in the scriptures of the religions professed by the recipients of His summons. “Never since the beginning of the world”, Bahá’u’lláh declares, “hath the Message been so openly proclaimed.” </text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P13"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="Standard"><text:span text:style-name="T5"><text:tab/>The present volume brings together the first full, authorized English translation of these major writings. <text:s/>Among them is the complete Súriy-i-Haykal, the Súrih of the Temple, one of Bahá’u’lláh’s most challenging works. <text:s/>It was originally revealed during His banishment to Adrianople and later recast after His arrival in ‘Akká. <text:s/>In this version He incorporated His messages addressed to individual potentates—Pope Pius IX, Napoleon III, Czar Alexander II, Queen Victoria, and Náṣiri’d-Dín </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T12">Sh</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T5">áh. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P13"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="Standard"><text:span text:style-name="T6"><text:tab/>It was this composite work which, shortly after its completion, Bahá’u’lláh instructed be written in the form of a pentacle, symbolizing the human temple. <text:s/>To it He added, as a conclusion, what Shoghi Effendi has described as “words which reveal the importance He attached to those Messages, and indicate their direct association with the prophecies of the Old Testament”: </text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P12"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Thus have We built the Temple with the hands of power and might, could ye but know it. <text:s/>This is the Temple promised unto you in the Book. <text:s/>Draw ye nigh unto it. <text:s/>This is that which profiteth you, could ye but comprehend it. <text:s/>Be fair, O peoples of the earth! <text:s/>Which is preferable, this, or a temple which is built of clay? <text:s/>Set your faces towards it. <text:s/>Thus have ye been commanded by God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P12"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P12">During the last years of His ministry Bahá’u’lláh Himself arranged for the publication for the first time of definitive versions of some of His principal works, and the Súriy-i-Haykal was awarded a prominent position among them.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P12"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="Standard"><text:span text:style-name="T6"><text:tab/>Of the various writings that make up the Súriy-i-Haykal, one requires particular mention. <text:s/>The Lawḥ-i-Sulṭán, the Tablet to Náṣiri’d-Dín </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T13">Sh</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T6">áh, Bahá’u’lláh’s lengthiest epistle to any single sovereign, was revealed in the weeks immediately preceding His final banishment to ‘Akká. <text:s/>It was eventually delivered to the monarch by Badí‘, a youth of seventeen, who had entreated Bahá’u’lláh for the honour of rendering some service. <text:s/>His efforts won him the crown of martyrdom and immortalized his name. <text:s/>The Tablet contains the celebrated passage describing the circumstances in which the divine call was communicated to Bahá’u’lláh and the effect it produced. <text:s/>Here, too, we find His unequivocal offer to meet with the Muslim clergy, in the presence of the </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T13">Sh</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T6">áh, and to provide whatever proofs of the new Revelation they might consider to be definitive, a test of spiritual integrity significantly failed by those who claimed to be the authoritative trustees of the message of the Qur’án.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P12"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P12"><text:soft-page-break/><text:tab/> Included in this collection, as well, is the first full translation of the Súriy-i-Mulúk or Súrih of the Kings, which Shoghi Effendi described as “the most momentous Tablet revealed by Bahá’u’lláh in which He, for the first time, directs His words collectively to the entire company of the monarchs of East and West”. <text:s/>It sets forth both the character of His mission and the standard of justice that must govern the exercise of their rule in this Day of God:</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P12"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Lay not aside the fear of God, O kings of the earth, and beware that ye transgress not the bounds which the Almighty hath fixed. <text:s/>Observe the injunctions laid upon you in His Book, and take good heed not to overstep their limits. <text:s/>Be vigilant, that ye may not do injustice to anyone, be it to the extent of a grain of mustard seed. <text:s/>Tread ye the path of justice, for this, verily, is the straight path.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P12"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P12"><text:tab/>The Tablet introduces some of the great themes that were to figure prominently in the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh over the next two and a half decades: <text:s/>the obligation of those into whose hands God has entrusted civil authority to institute the reign of justice, the necessity for the reduction of armaments and the resolution of conflicts among nations, and an end to the excessive expenditures that were impoverishing these rulers’ subjects. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P12"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P12"><text:tab/>Surveying the principal contents of Bahá’u’lláh’s majestic call to the kings and rulers of the world, Shoghi Effendi has written:</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P12"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The magnitude and diversity of the theme, the cogency of the argument, the sublimity and audacity of the language, arrest our attention and astound our minds. <text:s/>Emperors, kings and princes, chancellors and ministers, the Pope himself, priests, monks and philosophers, the exponents of learning, parliamentarians and deputies, the rich ones of the earth, the followers of all religions, and the people of Bahá—all are brought within the purview of the Author of these Messages, and receive, each according to their merits, the counsels and admonitions they deserve. <text:s/>No less amazing is the diversity of the subjects touched upon in these Tablets. <text:s/>The transcendent majesty and unity of an unknowable and unapproachable God is extolled, and the oneness of His Messengers proclaimed and emphasized. <text:s/>The uniqueness, the universality and potentialities of the Bahá’í Faith are stressed, and the purpose and character of the Bábí Revelation unfolded.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P12"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P12">The summary draws attention to Bahá’u’lláh’s uncompromising indictment of the conditions of human society for which its leadership is held primarily responsible:</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P12"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Episodes, at once moving and marvellous, at various stages of His ministry, are recounted, and the transitoriness of worldly pomp, fame, riches, and sovereignty, repeatedly and categorically asserted. <text:s/>Appeals for the application of the highest principles in human and international relations are forcibly and insistently made, and the abandonment of discreditable practices and conventions, detrimental to the happiness, the growth, the prosperity and the unity of the human race, enjoined. <text:s/>Kings are censured, ecclesiastical dignitaries arraigned, ministers and plenipotentiaries condemned, and the identification of His advent with the coming of the Father Himself unequivocally admitted and repeatedly announced. <text:s/>The violent downfall of a few of these kings and emperors is prophesied, two of them are definitely challenged, most are warned, all are appealed to and exhorted.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P12"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="Standard"><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T6"><text:tab/>In a Tablet, the original of which has been lost, Bahá’u’lláh had already condemned, in the severest terms, the misrule of the Ottoman Sulṭán ‘Abdu’l-‘Azíz. <text:s/>The present volume includes, however, three other Tablets which address two ministers of the Sulṭán, whose selfish and unprincipled influence played an important role in Bahá’u’lláh’s successive banishments. <text:s/>The Súriy-i-Ra’ís, which addresses ‘Álí Pá</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T13">sh</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T6">á, the Ottoman Prime Minister, was revealed in August 1868 as the exiles were being moved from Adrianople to Gallipoli, and exposes unsparingly the abuse of civil power the minister had perpetrated. <text:s/>The Lawḥ-i-Ra’ís, which also contains passages directed to ‘Álí Pá</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T13">sh</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T6">á, was revealed shortly after Bahá’u’lláh’s incarceration in the citadel of ‘Akká and includes a chilling denunciation of the character of the Minister. <text:s/>The third Tablet, the Lawḥ-i-Fu’ád, revealed in 1869 shortly after the death of Fu’ád Pá</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T13">sh</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T6">á, the Ottoman Minister to whose machinations it refers, describes the spiritual consequences of the abuse of power, and foretells the imminent downfall of his colleague, ‘Álí Pá</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T13">sh</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T6">á, and the overthrow of the Sulṭán himself—prophecies that were widely circulated and whose dramatic fulfilment added greatly to the prestige of their Author.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P13"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P87"><text:span text:style-name="T28"><text:tab/>It seems especially appropriate, as Bahá’u’lláh’s influence penetrates ever more deeply the life of the larger society throughout the world, that the full texts of these great Tablets should now be available for a broad readership. <text:s/>We express to the committees who were commissioned to undertake and review these translations the deep gratitude we feel for the care and sensitivity they have brought to the task. <text:s/>Bahá’ís will recognize key passages from several of the Tablets that were introduced to the West by Shoghi Effendi. <text:s/>His translations into English of the Bahá’í Holy Texts provide an enduring standard for the efforts of those who rise to the challenge of preparing appropriate renderings into English of these treasures of the Faith.</text:span></text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P26">46<text:tab/>O Fourth Letter of this Temple, betokening the attribute of Grace! <text:s/>We have made thee the manifestation of grace betwixt earth and heaven. <text:s/>From thee have We generated all grace in the contingent world, and unto thee shall We cause it to return. <text:s/>And from thee shall We manifest it again, through a word of Our command. <text:s text:c="2"/>Potent am I to accomplish whatsoever I desire through My word “Be”, and it is! <text:s/>Every grace that appeareth in the world of being hath originated from thee, and unto thee shall it return. <text:s/>This, verily, is what hath been ordained in a Tablet which We have preserved behind the veil of glory and concealed from mortal eyes. <text:s/>Well is it with them that deprive themselves not of this manifest and unfailing grace.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P50"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P28">47<text:tab/>Say: <text:s/>In this day, the fertilizing winds of the grace of God have passed over all things. <text:s/>Every creature hath been endowed with all the potentialities it can carry. <text:s/>And yet the peoples of the world have denied this grace! <text:s/>Every tree hath been endowed with the choicest fruits, every ocean enriched with the most luminous gems. <text:s/>Man, himself, hath been invested with the gifts of understanding and knowledge. <text:s/>The whole creation hath been made the recipient of the revelation of the All-Merciful, and the earth the repository of things inscrutable to all except God, the Truth, the Knower of things unseen. <text:s/>The time is approaching when every created thing will have cast its burden. <text:s/>Glorified be God Who hath vouchsafed this grace that encompasseth all things, whether seen or unseen! <text:s/>Thus have We created the whole earth anew in this day, yet most of the people have failed to perceive it. <text:s/>Say: <text:s/>The grace of God can never be adequately understood; how much less can His own Self, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting, be comprehended!</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P50"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P26">48<text:tab/>O Temple of the Cause! <text:s/>Grieve not if Thou findest none ready to receive Thy gifts. <text:s/>Thou wast created for My sake; occupy Thyself therefore with My praise amidst My servants. <text:s/>This is that which hath been ordained for Thee in the Preserved Tablet. <text:s/>Having found upon the earth many a soiled hand, We sanctified the hem of Thy garment from the profanity of their touch and placed it beyond the reach of the ungodly. <text:s/>Be patient in the Cause of Thy Lord, for erelong shall He raise up souls endowed with sanctified hearts and illumined eyes who shall flee from every quarter unto Thine all-encompassing and boundless grace.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P50"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P26"><text:soft-page-break/>49<text:tab/>O Temple of God! <text:s/>No sooner had the hosts of Divine Revelation been sent down by the Lord of all names and attributes bearing the banners of His signs, than the exponents of doubt and fancy were put to flight. <text:s/>They disbelieved in the clear tokens of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting, and rose up against Him in enmity and opposition. <text:s/>Amongst them were those who claimed: <text:s/>“These are not clear verses from God, nor do they proceed from an innate and untaught nature.” <text:s/>Thus do the unbelievers seek to remedy the sickness of their hearts, utterly heedless that they thus render themselves accursed of all who dwell in heaven and on earth.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P50"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P28">50<text:tab/>Say: <text:s/>The Holy Spirit Itself hath been generated through the agency of a single letter revealed by this Most Great Spirit, if ye be of them that comprehend. <text:s/>And that innate and untaught nature in its essence is called into being by the verses of God, the Help in Peril, the All-Glorious, the Best-Beloved. <text:s/>Say: <text:s/>This nature prideth itself in its relation to Our transcendent Truth, whilst We, for Our part, glory neither in it nor in aught else, for all beside Myself hath been created through the potency of My word, could ye but understand.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P50"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P28">51<text:tab/>Say: <text:s/>We have revealed Our verses in nine different modes. <text:s/>Each one of them bespeaketh the sovereignty of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. <text:s/>A single one of them sufficeth for a proof unto all who are in the heavens and on the earth; yet the people, for the most part, persist in their heedlessness. <text:s/>Should it be Our wish, We would reveal them in countless other modes. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P50"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P31"><text:span text:style-name="T4">52<text:tab/>Say: <text:s/>O people! <text:s/>Fear ye God, and allow not your tongues to utter, in their deceitfulness, that which displeaseth Him. <text:s/>Stand abashed before the One Who, as ye well know, hath created you out of a drop of water.</text:span><text:span text:style-name="Endnote_20_Symbol"><text:span text:style-name="T4"><text:note text:id="ftn5" text:note-class="endnote"><text:note-citation>4</text:note-citation><text:note-body>

   <text:p text:style-name="P28">53<text:tab/>Say: <text:s/>The Word of God can never be confounded with the words of His creatures. <text:s/>It is, in truth, the King of words, even as He is Himself the sovereign Lord of all, and His Cause transcendeth all that was and all that shall be. <text:s/>Enter, O people, the City of Certitude wherein the throne of your Lord, the All-Merciful, hath been established. <text:s/>Thus biddeth you the Pen of the All-Glorious, as a token of His unfailing grace. <text:s/>Haply ye may not make His Revelation a cause of dissension amongst you.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P26">54<text:tab/>Among the infidels are those who have repudiated His Self and risen up against His Cause, and who claim that these divine verses are contrived. <text:s/>Such also were the objections of the deniers of old, who now implore deliverance from the Fire. <text:s/>Say: <text:s/>Woe betide you for the idle words that proceed from your mouths! <text:s/>If these verses be indeed contrived, then by what proof have ye believed in God? <text:s/>Produce it, <text:soft-page-break/>if ye be men of understanding! <text:s/>Whensoever We revealed Our clear verses unto such men, they rejected them, and whensoever they beheld that which the combined forces of the earth are powerless to produce, they pronounced it sorcery. <text:s/></text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P26">55<text:tab/>What aileth this people that they speak of that which they understand not? <text:s/>They raise the same objections as did the followers of the Qur’án when their Lord came unto them with His Cause. <text:s/>They, verily, are a rejected people. <text:s/>They hindered others from appearing before Him Who is the Ancient Beauty, and from sharing the bread of His loved ones. <text:s/>“Approach them not,” one was even heard to say, “for they cast a spell upon the people and lead them astray from the path of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.” <text:s/>By the righteousness of the one true God! <text:s/>He who is incapable of speaking in Our presence hath uttered such words as none among the former generations hath ever spoken, and hath committed such acts as none of the unbelievers of bygone ages hath ever committed. <text:s/></text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P50"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P26">59<text:tab/>If He be truly unconstrained, behold then how He hath sent down the Manifestation of His Cause with verses which naught in the heavens or on the earth <text:soft-page-break/>can withstand! <text:s/>Such hath been the manner of their revelation that they have neither peer nor likeness in the world of being, as ye yourselves beheld and heard when once the Daystar of the world shone forth above the horizon of ‘Iráq with manifest dominion. <text:s/>All things attain their consummation in the divine verses, and these indeed are the verses of God, the Sovereign Lord, the Help in Peril, the All-Glorious, the Almighty. <text:s/>Beyond this, He hath been made manifest as the Bearer of a Cause whose sovereign might is acknowledged by all created things, and this none can deny save the sinners and the ungodly.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P54"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P72"><text:tab/><text:tab/><text:tab/><text:tab/>He is God, exalted be His glory!</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="Block_20_Text"><text:span text:style-name="T65">210<text:tab/></text:span>It is clear and evident that the one true God—glorified be His mention!—is sanctified above the world and all that is therein. <text:s/>By “rendering assistance unto God”, then, it is not meant that any soul should fight or contend with another. <text:s/>That Sovereign Lord Who doeth whatsoever He pleaseth hath entrusted the kingdom of creation, its lands and its seas, into the hands of the kings, for they are, each according to his degree, the manifestations of His divine power. <text:s/>Should they enter beneath the shadow of the True One, they will be accounted of God, and if not, thy Lord, verily, knoweth and observeth all things. <text:s/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P75"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P74">211<text:tab/>That which God—glorified be His Name!—hath desired for Himself is the hearts of His servants, which are the treasuries of His love and remembrance and the repositories of His knowledge and wisdom. <text:s/>It hath ever been the wish of the Eternal King to cleanse the hearts of His servants from the things of the world and all that pertaineth thereunto, that they may be made worthy recipients of the effulgent splendours of Him Who is the King of all names and attributes. <text:s/>Wherefore must no stranger be allowed in the city of the heart, that the incomparable Friend may enter His abode. <text:s/>By this is meant the effulgence of His names and attributes, and not His exalted Essence, inasmuch as that peerless King hath ever been, and shall eternally remain, sanctified above ascent and descent. <text:s/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P75"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P73"><text:span text:style-name="T9">212<text:tab/>It followeth, therefore, that rendering assistance unto God, in this day, doth not and shall never consist in contending or disputing with any soul; nay rather, what is preferable in the sight of God is that the cities of men’s hearts, which are ruled by the hosts of self and passion, should be subdued by the sword of utterance, of wisdom and of understanding. <text:s/>Thus, whoso seeketh to assist God must, before all else, conquer, with the sword of inner meaning and explanation, the city of his own heart and guard it from the remembrance of all save God, and only then set out to subdue the cities of the hearts of others.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P75"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P73"><text:span text:style-name="T9">213<text:tab/>Such is the true meaning of rendering assistance unto God. <text:s/>Sedition hath never been pleasing unto God, nor were the acts committed in the past by certain foolish ones acceptable in His sight. <text:s/>Know ye that to be killed in the path of His good pleasure is better for you than to kill. <text:s/>The beloved of the Lord must</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">,</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T9"> in this day, behave in such wise amidst His servants that they may by their very deeds and actions guide all men unto the paradise of the All-Glorious.</text:span></text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P74">214<text:tab/>By Him Who shineth above the Dayspring of Sanctity! <text:s/>The friends of God have not, nor will they ever, set their hopes upon the world and its <text:soft-page-break/>ephemeral possessions. <text:s/>The one true God hath ever regarded the hearts of men as His own, His exclusive possession—and this too but as an expression of His all-surpassing mercy, that haply mortal souls may be purged and sanctified from all that pertaineth to the world of dust and gain admittance into the realms of eternity. <text:s/>For otherwise that ideal King is, in Himself and by Himself, sufficient unto Himself and independent of all things. <text:s/>Neither doth the love of His creatures profit Him, nor can their malice harm Him. <text:s/>All have issued forth from abodes of dust, and unto dust shall they return, while the one true God, alone and single, is established upon His Throne, a Throne which is beyond the reaches of time and space, is sanctified above all utterance or expression, intimation, description and definition, and is exalted beyond all notion of abasement and glory. <text:s/>And none knoweth this save Him and those with whom is the knowledge of the Book. <text:s/>No God is there but Him, the Almighty, the All-Bountiful.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P50"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P26">215<text:tab/>It behoveth the benevolence of the Sovereign, however, to examine all matters with the eye of justice and mercy, and not to content himself with the baseless claims of certain individuals. <text:s/>We beseech God to graciously assist the King to fulfil that which He pleaseth, and, verily, that which He desireth should be the desire of all the worlds.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P26">217<text:tab/>A just king is the shadow of God on earth. <text:s/>All should seek shelter under the shadow of his justice, and rest in the shade of his favour. <text:s/>This is not a matter which is either specific or limited in its scope, that it might be restricted to one or another person, inasmuch as the shadow telleth of the One Who casteth it. <text:s/>God, glorified be His remembrance, hath called Himself the Lord of the worlds, for He hath nurtured and still nurtureth everyone. <text:s/>Glorified be, then, His grace that hath preceded all created things, and His mercy that hath surpassed the worlds.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P119"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P118">32<text:tab/>As to the soul which is intended, in truth it hath been called forth by the Word of God and is such that, if it be kindled with the fire of the love of its Lord, neither the waters of opposition nor the oceans of the world can quench its flame. <text:s/>That soul is indeed a fire ablaze in the tree of man which proclaimeth: <text:s/>“No God is there but Him!” <text:s/>Whosoever hearkeneth unto its call is verily of those who have attained unto Him. <text:s/>And when it casteth off its earthly frame, God shall raise it up again in the most excellent of forms and cause it to enter a sublime paradise. <text:s/>Thy Lord, of a certainty, hath power over all things.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P68"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P47">12<text:tab/>At that moment a volley of shots was fired, a fanfare of trumpets was sounded, and king and tent were enveloped in a pall of smoke. <text:s/>When it had cleared, the king, ensconced upon his throne, was seen surrounded by a suite of ministers, princes, and dignitaries of state who, having taken their places, were standing at attention in his presence. <text:s/>A captured thief was then brought before the king, who gave the order that the offender should be beheaded. <text:s/>Without a moment’s delay the chief executioner cut off the thief’s head, whence a blood-like liquid came forth. <text:s/>After this the king held audience with his court, during which intelligence was received that a rebellion had broken out on a certain frontier. <text:s/>Thereupon the king reviewed his troops and despatched several regiments supported by artillery to quell the uprising. <text:s/>A few moments later cannons were heard booming from behind the tent, and it was announced that a battle had been engaged. </text:p>
